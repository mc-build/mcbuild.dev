## Code Of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as owners, contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language[[definition](#inclusive-language)]
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- No feigning surprise
- No well-actually's[[definition](#subtle--isms)]
- No subtle -isms[[definition](#subtle--isms)]

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting @FetchBot#1225, @SnaveSutit or an Admin . We will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The staff team is expected to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident to the community or offending party. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

_The Moderation Team is also subject to these rules and expectations, please feel free to reach out to me personally if you spot any infringement of these rules by the moderation team and I will do my best to take swift action to resolve the infringement._

#### Punishments

1. A private warning and potential removal of message
   - This may be repeated.
2. A temporary mute of the offending party(s) on one or more servers under this code of conduct.
3. The offending party(s) being kicked from the server for a period of time.
4. The offending party(s) will be banned.

### Definitions

#### well-actually

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn't mean we aren't about truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise. Almost all well-actually's in our experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking.

\*_ from the [hack & tell](https://hackandtell.org/#code_of_conduct) code of conduct_

#### subtle -ism

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It's so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big deal to mess up – you just apologize and move on.

\*_ from the [hack & tell](https://hackandtell.org/#code_of_conduct) code of conduct_

#### inclusive language

Inclusive language aims to avoid offense and fulfill the ideals of egalitarianism by avoiding expressions that express or imply ideas that are sexist, racist, or otherwise biased, prejudiced, or denigrating to any particular group of people (and sometimes animals as well).
